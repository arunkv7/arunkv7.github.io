Hi! I am Arun Kumar Varanasi, currently a Ph.D. student at Engineering Mechanics Unit. Soon, I will be joining as a Postdoctoral Fellow at Fluid Dynamics and Turbulence group at TIFR-ICTS (International Centre for Theoretical Sciences). My research interests are in Fluid mechanics and Applied Mathematics. Currently, I am interested in the energy transfers and nonlinear interactions in turbulence. My Ph.D. thesis is titled "Fluid drift and spheroid rotation is viscous density stratified fluids".
