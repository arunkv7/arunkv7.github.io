Hi! I am Arun Kumar Varanasi, currently a Ph.D. student at Engineering Mechanics Unit. Soon, I will be joining as a Postdoctoral Fellow at Fluid Dynamics and Turbulence group at TIFR-ICTS (International Centre for Theoretical Sciences). My research interests are in the areas of Fluid mechanics and Applied Mathematics. Currently, I am interested in the energy transfers and nonlinear interactions in turbulence and geophysical flows as part of my postdoctoral work. I am also interested in developing understanding of factors contrbuting to World's oceanic circulation, especially in the idea of biogenic mixing. 

My Ph.D. thesis is titled "Fluid drift and spheroid rotation is viscous density stratified fluids".  My thesis work involves characterizing the fluid motion due to motion of a sphere and the rotation of a spheroid in a density stratified both in the convection dominant limit. The first part involves the calculation of 'Darwin' drift for a density stratified medium and is shown to be a convergent quantity. The second part involves the calculation of the rotation of spheroid in a density stratified medium and our caclculations explained the non-trivial orientations observed in recent experiments.

I am also interested in teaching a number of related ideas in a pedagogical manner and I spend bit of my time writing notes related to this.
