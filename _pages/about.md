Hi! I am Arun Kumar Varanasi, currently a Ph.D. student at Engineering Mechanics Unit. Soon, I will be joining as a Postdoctoral Fellow at Fluid Dynamics and Turbulence group at TIFR-ICTS (International Centre for Theoretical Sciences). My research interests are in the areas of Fluid mechanics and Applied Mathematics and I am passionated by the spatio-temporal dynamics of fluids that can be described by applied mathematics tools. Currently, I am interested in the energy transfers and nonlinear interactions in turbulence and geophysical flows as part of my postdoctoral work.  


My Ph.D. thesis is titled "Fluid drift and spheroid rotation is viscous density stratified fluids".  My thesis work involves characterizing the fluid motion due to motion of a sphere and the rotation of a spheroid in a density stratified both in the convection dominant limit. The first part involves the calculation of 'Darwin' drift for a density stratified medium and this is shown to be a convergent quantity. The second part about the rotation of spheroid in density stratified medium explained the recent experimental observations. 

I am also interested in teaching a number of related ideas in a pedagogical manner and I spend sometime writing notes on this.
