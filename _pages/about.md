We study the dynamics of particles and tracers in stratified and rotating fluid flows and also flow field induced by motion of both passive and active particles in these anisotropic flows.  There is also emphasis on the particle shape with particular emphasis on how background structure, turbulence, and external forces influence transport, mixing, and intermittency. Our work combines theoretical analysis with direct numerical simulations to uncover the mechanisms governing particle motion in environmental and geophysical flows.

A central theme of our research is the connection between microscopic particle dynamics and macroscopic flow properties. We investigate Lagrangian statistics, particle-induced fluid drift, and the role of stratification and rotation in modifying classical turbulence phenomenology. These questions are motivated by problems in oceans, atmosphere, and engineered stratified systems.

Our approach emphasizes physical understanding through scaling arguments, and asymptotic reasoning that can complement large-scale DNS simulations. More broadly, our work lies at the interface of fluid mechanics, applied mathematics, and environmental physics. We also look into the aspects of development of  macroscopic models of advanced battery systems.

I welcome interactions with students and collaborators interested in theoretical and computational aspects of fluid mechanics.
