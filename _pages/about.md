I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at Fluid Dynamics and Turbulence group at TIFR-ICTS (International Centre for Theoretical Sciences), Bangalore.

My research interests are mainly in the areas of Fluid Mechanics and Applied Mathematics. I mainly use tools such as perturbation methods, asymptotic analysis and also often employ numerical methods as required. 

My Ph.D. thesis is titled "Fluid drift and spheroid rotation is viscous density stratified fluids" and I have carried out my research under the guidance of Prof. Ganesh Subramanian at Engineering Mechanics Unit at JNCASR, Bangalore.  My thesis work involves characterizing the fluid motion due to motion of a sphere and the rotation of a spheroid in a density stratified fluid both in the convection dominant limit. The first part involves the calculation of 'Darwin' drift for a density stratified medium and this is shown to be a convergent quantity. The second part involves the calculation of the rotation of spheroid in a density stratified medium and our calculations explained the non-trivial orientations observed in the recent experiments.

I am also interested in teaching a number of related ideas in a pedagogical manner, and you may find related notes and codes on my web page.
